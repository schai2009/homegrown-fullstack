I have been struggling with my Ficus elastica lately, I have had her for 10 years and have recently run into poorly drained soil and spidermites which caused a lot of leaf loss. I changed her soil and pot recently so it is better drained, and put her into a self watering pot. Do you think the Ficus will do okay in a self watering pot?',

If it keeps the soil consistently moist, then I would assume it wouldnâ€™t work well for cacti and succulents, and if a plant requires very moist soil all the time would the soil be able to retain enough water with self watering?',

      comment_text: 'When I get the idea of urban jungle I started to create it on my own in my flat. I was looking for plants in many places due to the fact that I did not want to spend much money for them. That is how I got monstera and howea forsteriana. I have also other plants that you did not mentioned here like for example zamioculcas which perfectly fit into the urban jungle idea. What I also found on another blogs was to use various herbs because they are also deciduous and do not stray from the urban jungle concept. As I love basil I ordered this variety of basil seeds from https://gardenseedsmarket.com/home-garden-basil-variety-mix-for-indoor-and-balcony-cultivation-great-basil-saint-joseph-s-wort.html and planted them into a pretty small pot. You can also use other herbs but I found this idea amazing. Try it!',

I was hearing some plant growers that moving plants around was good. I was not sure that was the best advice and thanks to you I am now sure. Will keep my indoor friends still when possible. Thank you so much.',
